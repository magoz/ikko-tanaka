## About

[Ikko Tanaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikko_Tanaka) was one of my favorite graphic designers and I love his work very much.

It's my **second** time to try to create them with pure CSS (after 4 years). Now I can use CSS grid and clip-path instead of hacking with border-width or linear-gradient. But it's still challenging to make them all responsive and deal with the sub-pixel problem in CSS.

Cheers!
